                This section will explain Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. It will highlight that Type 1 diabetes typically manifests during childhood or adolescence and necessitates lifelong insulin therapy.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>B. Type 2 Diabetes</b>
                Focusing on the most common type of diabetes, this section will provide an overview of Type 2 diabetes, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough of it. It will emphasize the association with lifestyle factors, such as poor diet and sedentary behavior, and the potential for managing Type 2 diabetes through lifestyle modifications and medication.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>C. Prediabetes:</b>
                This section will shed light on prediabetes, a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. It will explain the significance of prediabetes as an indicator of increased risk for developing Type 2 diabetes and discuss preventive measures that can be taken to halt its progression.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>D. Gestational Diabetes:</b>
                Focusing on pregnancy-related diabetes, this section will discuss gestational diabetes, a temporary condition that affects some pregnant women. It will highlight the importance of managing gestational diabetes to safeguard the health of both the mother and the baby, while also noting that it typically resolves after childbirth.
